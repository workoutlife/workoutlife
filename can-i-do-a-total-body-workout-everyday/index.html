I only have limited days I can get to the gym and latley instead of doing upperbody or lowerbody I just do full body strenth workouts. This means that if you are an advanced lifter and train 6 days per week you may need to do 3-5 sets per muscle group each workout this means that whole body workouts are more beneficial than split-type workouts. The American College of Sports Medicine ACSM recommends full-body workout two times a week for beginners and about three-four times a week for seasoned trainers. However doing a full-body workout every day is not ideal. Hence these must not be attempted daily.</p>

I only have limited days I can get to the gym and latley instead of doing upperbody or lowerbody I just do full body strenth workouts. Full body workouts help to slow this decline because you are recruiting multiple muscles to work together as a unit. For instance a 3-day program would most likely mean fitting a workout.</p>
